## TITLE; Tranquil Mind: Mental Health Mobile Application using Geolocation

### 1.0 Project Background
- Developing mobile applications for mental health patients diagnosed with or who have symptoms of depression, anxiety, or Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
- Mental Health refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It includes their ability to control emotions, think logically, maintain healthy social relationships, and cope with life's problems.
- Mobile apps are alternatives that help increase engagement, facilitate therapy, and retain gains when treatment is over to provide mental health services that are more inexpensive and accessible (Noronha,2022).
- This application will use geolocation services to identify the geographic location of the nearest clinic and counseling center.
