##INTRODUCTION

1.1	Background of Study

City is an area where large numbers of residents of all ages live together. City provides many job opportunity and many houses for people around the country. According to Lampard (2023), city is defined by centre of population which is larger in size and importance compared to town or village. It is also permanent and highly ordered.

1.2	Problem Statement

1.2.1	Whereabouts not known to other people make it hard to trace if missing
1.2.2	Panic during emergencies make it difficult to effectively provide information
1.2.3	Lack of awareness of dangerous spot in the city can lead to safety risks

1.3	Objectives

a)To design and develop Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety App using Geolocation for citizens in Jasin

b)To evaluate the effectiveness of Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety App using Geolocation using User Acceptance Testing

1.4	Project scope

1.4.1	Location

The Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app will be used in Malacca City which is the capital city of Malacca. The capital city covers 307.86 square kilometers consists of famous city spots such as A Famosa and Dataran Pahlawan. These area with a lot of tourist can be dangerous especially during the night. Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app will be most helpful when anything bad happen.

1.4.2	Users

Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app will benefits anyone inside Malacca City. User can add trusted family and friends to Circles. Circles is a group that user can share real-time location. Only Circles members are allowed to see current location and location history.

1.4.3	Technology

Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety App is using geolocation to track user. Push notifications to alert user of any incidents or weather change. Mapping services to show user location and any hotspot location. Authentication to make sure only selected people can access user location.

1.4.4	Mode

Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app is online but can be used offline with limited functionality.

1.4.5	Functionality

One of the functionality of Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app is to track and locate user. User may add any trusted family or friends into Circles, which then user can allow to track and locate. Only Circles members can see real-time location of the user on the map. The app also will check in the location for certain time set up by user. For example, for every 10 minutes, the app will check in and show the location on location history.

Secondly, emergency call. When activated, the app will alert Circles members and nearby user that the owner is in danger. Loud sound will also be played to attract attention.

Next, we can report area with many cases such as robbery, pickpocket and road obstruction. The reported areas will show up as hotspot area if enough report received. Reported areas will appear on map to alert user.

Other than that, the app has built-in map that shows authorities nearby, for example police station, in case of emergency. It also shows hotspot area nearby. Hotspot area is an area where many cases were reported by user. For instance, robbery. Circles members location will also be shown and user can get direction to go to them.

Lastly, the user will receive push notification for weather and incident alert. Whenever the forecast for the city is bad, such as thunderstom, the app will give notification. Moreover, if the user is near 5 kilometer to a hotspot area, the app will give warning so that the user is aware.
