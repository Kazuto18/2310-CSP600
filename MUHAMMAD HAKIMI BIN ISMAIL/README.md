# CHAPTER 1

## INTRODUCTION

### Background of Study

City is an area where large numbers of residents of all ages live together. City provides many job opportunity and many houses for people around the country. According to Lampard (2023), city is defined by centre of population which is larger in size and importance compared to town or village. It is also permanent and highly ordered.

### Problem Statement

- Current safety applications lack of tools to produce admissible evidence for police cases.
- No easily accessible panic button in exisiting safety applications.
- Existing safety applications do not alert users about dangerous spots in the city.

### Objectives

- To design and develop Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety App using geofencing and geotagging.

- To evaluate the accuracy of geofencing and geotagging on Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety App using geolocation testing tool.

### Project scope

1. Location
   * The Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app will be used in Malacca City which is the capital city of Malacca. The capital city covers 307.86 square kilometers and consists of famous city spots such as A Famosa and Dataran Pahlawan. These areas with a lot of tourists can be dangerous especially during the night. Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app will be most helpful when unwanted things happen.

2.	Users
    * Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app will benefits anyone inside Malacca City. User can add trusted family and friends to Circles. Circles is a group that user can share real-time location. Only Circles members are allowed to see current location and location history.

3. Technology
   * Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety App is using geofencing, geolocation and geotagging to track user. Geofencing services to alert user of any incidents or weather change nearby. Geolocation services to track user’s location in real-time. Geotagging to attach geographic coordinates to photos and videos.

4. Mode
   * Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety app is online but can be used offline with limited functionality which is offline maps and panic button.

5. Functionality
   * Track and Locate
   * Panic Button
   * Community Report
   * Maps with alert
   * Push notification

### Project Significance

* Automatic video recording with anto-tempering implementation during emergency
* Essential information will be send to trusted person and user nearby when easily accessible ‘Panic Button’ activated
* Maps shows real-time potentially dangerous cases with alert using geofencing

### Summary

Waspada: City Track and Locate Safety App aims to enhance city safety by using geofencing, geolocation, and geotagging technologies. Waspada application will provides improvements from existing app features according to the standard of current technology.
