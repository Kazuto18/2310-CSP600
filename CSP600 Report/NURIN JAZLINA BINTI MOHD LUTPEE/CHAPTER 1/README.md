## TITLE; Tranquil Mind: Mental Health Mobile Application using Geolocation

### 1.1 Project Background
Mental health encompasses a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being, including their capacity to manage emotions, think rationally, maintain healthy social connections, and cope with life's challenges. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) (2001), mental health is defined as a state of well-being in which an individual recognizes their abilities, can effectively manage everyday stressors, work productively, and contribute positively to the community. Conversely, as per the Malaysian Ministry of Health (1997), mental health results from the interplay between an individual, their community, and an environment that promotes optimal functioning and subjective well-being. Achieving justice necessitates the application of cognitive, emotional, and relational skills.

The highest rate of mental disorders was documented in rural areas of East Malaysia at 43%, followed by Kuala Lumpur, the nation's capital, at 40%. Rural areas typically experience poorer socioeconomic conditions, characterized by higher rates of unemployment and poverty. This can lead to the development and persistence of mental health issues, compounded by factors such as stigma and limited access to both general and mental healthcare (Raaj et al., 2021). Mobile apps offer an affordable and accessible alternative to enhance engagement, facilitate therapy, and sustain progress after treatment (Noronha, 2022).

This project proposes a mental health mobile application to assist individuals diagnosed with or displaying symptoms of depression, anxiety, or Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as assessed by experts such as counselors, doctors, and psychiatrists. The application will enable users to conduct preliminary assessments, schedule appointments with experts, monitor their mood and progress and access self-help resources. Additionally, the application will determine the nearest clinic and counseling center using geolocation technologies.



### 1.2 Problem Statement
#### 1.2.1 Obstacles Preventing Individuals from Seeking Help

Patients with mental health issues face a variety of obstacles that can prevent them from seeking help. There are several difficulties that people face when it comes to mental health. These include the negative attitudes and stereotypes surrounding mental health, difficulties in accessing affordable care, concerns about medications, and the challenges of being admitted to hospitals. Additionally, many individuals are affected by cultural and religious beliefs that stigmatize mental health issues, lack of support from loved ones, and fear of discrimination or legal consequences. Mental health problems become challenging when individuals refuse treatment (Saboo, 2021). If these stereotypes and mentalities persist, the state of mental health will deteriorate day by day.
	
People can take control of their mental health by using tools such as the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS) test and self-help techniques which are one of the features of this mobile application. People can actively contribute to their emotional well-being by incorporating self-help methods into their everyday routines. This application provides a common psychological evaluation tool, the DASS exam provides an objective assessment of an individual's emotional state and will enable people to identify their problem and monitor changes over time. This application will enhance the individual to control their mental health, seek assistance when necessary, and make decisions that support psychological resilience.

#### 1.2.2 Forgot to attend an appointment and track medication

Many people with mental health conditions forget to take their medication or miss appointments with their mental health professionals (Saboo, 2021). This can happen for several reasons, including the stresses of everyday life and cognitive difficulties associated with certain mental health conditions. Skipping therapy sessions or appointments with mental health professionals, or not taking medication as prescribed, can disrupt treatment and prevent success. As a result, people may unintentionally miss therapy sessions or appointments, which can disrupt their treatment and make it harder for them to get better.

“Tranquil Mind: Mental Health Mobile Application using Geolocation Services” dedicated to mental health can be a valuable tool for individuals seeking to manage their mental health effectively. It can help users keep track of their appointments, set reminders, and monitor their medication schedules. This proactive approach not only helps people stay on top of their mental health care, but it also helps mental health professionals provide more consistent and effective treatment.

#### 1.2.3 Costly and time-consuming procedures

People in rural areas have difficulty managing their mental health because there are not many mental health clinics or counseling centers nearby. This can be a problem because it can be expensive and time-consuming to travel to a distant facility. Research by Yang in 2021 found that this is a serious problem for people in rural areas.

One way to address this problem would be to develop a mental health mobile app with features for scheduling appointments. This would make it easier for people in rural areas to book appointments, which would save them time and money. This would also give them better access to mental health care, which would improve their mental health and well-being.

### 1.3 Objective

1. To develop a mobile application that assists individuals diagnosed with or displaying symptoms of mental health conditions in scheduling appointments and accessing self-help resources.
2. To evaluate the app's design for user-friendliness, ease of navigation, and accessibility using functionality testing.


### 1.4	Project Scope

#### 1.4.1 Area

The "Tranquil Mind: Mental Health Mobile Application using Geolocation" is specialized in Jasin, Melaka. It provides a convenient and accessible way for people in Jasin to access support. However, the application is not limited to a specific location; individuals in Jasin can use it from anywhere and at any time. 

#### 1.4.2 Users

The application serves two user categories which are the admin side, operated by experts such as doctors, psychiatrists, and counselors, and the client side, focusing on individuals with mental health diagnoses or symptoms.

#### 1.4.3 Technology

This application will implement geolocation and cloud services to recommend the nearest clinic and counseling center, store and manage client data, run applications, and deliver content like self-help tools to users.

Geolocation services will be used to determine the user's location, which will then be used to recommend the nearest clinic or counseling center. Cloud services will be used to store and manage client data, such as contact information, and treatment progress. Cloud services will also be used to run applications, such as a therapist directory and a self-help tool library. Finally, cloud services will be used to deliver content, such as self-help articles and videos, to users.


#### 1.4.4 Functionality 

Mental health mobile apps offer a variety of features to support users and administrators. For users, they can create a personalized profile that includes their name, phone number, and other relevant details. This helps to personalize the user experience and makes it easier for administrators to monitor and assist users. The DASS test provides an early assessment of the user's mental health, delivering immediate results and insightful feedback. This can help users to better understand their emotional state and identify areas where they may need support and seek help from experts.

Tranquil Mind also has features such as a crisis helpline and emergency contact. This mobile application provides a lifeline for users in times of crisis by connecting them with their relatives. Mental health self-improvement tools also play an important role as they include educational resources, mood tracking, journaling, relaxation activities, and guided meditation sessions. This tool empowers users to actively engage in their mental health journey and work towards a more balanced emotional state. Additionally, Tranquil Mind will allow customers to book appointments from their smartphones and receive reminders about upcoming appointments.

For admins, mental health mobile applications provide a comprehensive user management system. This system allows admins to monitor and assist users effectively, including reviewing user profiles, identifying users who may need additional support, and managing emergency services and crisis helplines. Admins can also oversee the appointment booking system to ensure a smooth and efficient process, including managing their schedules based on the admin’s availability.

### 1.5	Significance
#### 1.5.1 Individuals can practice self-help tools and do the DASS test to enhance their awareness about mental health.

Tranquil Mind offers a variety of self-help tools to help users improve their mental well-being. These tools include educational materials, exercises, and resources designed to help users manage stress, anxiety, and depression. The app also includes the DASS test, a self-assessment tool that provides users with insights into their emotional state and helps them to become more aware of their mental health. This combination of self-help tools and self-assessment gives users the power to take control of their mental well-being and make informed decisions about their emotional health.

#### 1.5.2 The application will notify the patients to attend their appointments and take the medicine.

Tranquil Mind includes a reminder system that helps patients stay on track with their mental health care. This system sends patients timely and personalized notifications about upcoming appointments with healthcare professionals, as well as reminders to take their medications at the prescribed times. By helping patients adhere to their treatment plans, this reminder system contributes to their overall mental health and well-being.

#### 1.5.3 Ease of Appointment Scheduling
Tranquil Mind's appointment scheduling feature makes it easy and affordable for users to get the mental health care they need. By allowing users to book appointments with mental health professionals directly from the app, Tranquil Mind saves users the time and money that would otherwise be spent on making phone calls or visiting clinics in person. This makes mental health care more accessible and affordable for everyone.
