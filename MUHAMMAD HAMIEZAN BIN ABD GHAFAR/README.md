Background of Study

In the 21st century, house pricing has become a major issue in the mind of society as its price keeps soaring, ultimately passing years. According to National Property Information Centre (NAPIC), MoF, the Malaysian House Price Index (MHPI) stood at 210.1 points (RM453,365 per unit) in 1Q 2023 with a marginal annual growth of 2.0 per cent, almost similar to the pre-pandemic growth (Bernama, 2023). The price trends that keep increasing annually have long shifted people's minds to renting a house rather than owning a house. Although rental rates have also experienced an increase, the most significant gap between the escalating expenses associated with homeownership and the upward trend in rental costs is evident in areas where home prices have seen the most substantial acceleration (Danielle Nguyen, 2022). Even in current trends between younger generations such as students, small families and bachelors, they tend to rent a house for several years before moving into a bigger property. This kind of trick is a wise move to take on when we do not have  the capital yet to sustain the monthly mortgage of a house and we spend a few years raking in a good amount of house deposit while achieving financial stability.  Nevertheless, each solution approach brings along its unique set of challenges. Renting comes with its own difficulties that may be caused by various factors  such as its tenant, lessor or contracts.



This project attempts to discover the underlying issues when it comes to renting and provide a smart solution for the problem. Renting is a usually fixed periodical return, especially an agreed sum, made by a tenant or occupant of property to the owner for the possession and use thereof, paid at fixed intervals by a tenant to the landlord ("Merriam-Webster Dictionary," n,d). By this definition, we can understand that renting is when both lessor and renter agreed on a certain condition to allow things to be rented. In our context of study, we emphasize on the renting issues that arise when renting a house. When it comes to renting a house, it requires the presence of renter, lessor, house to be rented and agreement from both sides.  Under the National Land Code, any rental under three years is defined as a ‘tenancy’, and does not require registration (National Land Code.n,d). In this case, for any rental activity to be done there is no need to notify the local authorities about the renting activity. According to Section 213(2) of the National Land Code, a tenancy shall be valid whether it is affected in writing or verbally by word of mouth, and if the tenancy is affected by writing, the instrument shall not be capable of registration. A simple digest of the sentence implies that any rental agreement can be done without the presence of a physical contract and can be done orally. This law also reprimands that the written tenancy agreements, while valid and legally binding, cannot be formally registered with a government authority for the purpose of recording or public notice. Registration is typically done for purposes of public record-keeping and to protect the interests of the parties involved in the agreement. Even from a common perspective, this kind of loophole in law may provide a backdoor for irresponsible people soon and later. Especially a contract that was made orally can be modified at will that may disrupt the balance in the agreement. A proper justifications need to be done to resolve this kind of issues,




In a different perspective. Blockchain technology is a digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers, creating a secure and transparent chain of information. Blockchain technology can be regarded as an emerging technology that is able to solve multiple existing problems at once. According to Raj Karkara, blockchain has the potential to tackle a range of critical issues, including supply chains, intellectual property, government processes, charitable activities, voting systems, and crowdfunding. Due to its capacity to improve transparency and fairness while also saving businesses time and money, it is having a profound impact on many industries (Karkara Raj,2023). In the context of this study, the project attempts to utilize blockchain technology in solving the trends of issues related to rental contracts. Most common issue is the absence of a proper rental contract that was done verbally and open for being tempered at any time. According to Ashraf Wahab, problems that may occur during tenancy from renter side are the rental fees may change abruptly, failure of getting back deposits while  on the lessor side, damage in property and payment overdue from tenants. The issue listed here may appear different to many people, however the key factors come from weak documentation of rights in contract and the absence of said agreement. The uniqueness of blockchain may come from its capability of being immutable that signifies its abilities to be altered (Adam Hayes, 2023). 
Problem Statement

At present, a significant number of university students choose to live off-campus, with the majority opting to rent houses. This is a departure from their on-campus experience where interactions are mainly with the college management department. When living off-campus, students engage with local tenancy agencies or landlords and must be well-versed in creating fair, balanced contracts that protect their rights. Failure to do so can prove detrimental, potentially leading to issues in their tenancy agreements. University students seeking off-campus housing are often vulnerable to unfair rental agreements and potential scams by landlords. A recent study conducted by the Department of Law at UiTM Tapah identified 21 reported rental housing issues in Tapah, Perak in 2017, a number that rose to 23 in 2018 (Abdul Razak, Kasmaruddin, & Kassim, 2019). These findings highlight a pressing concern: the presence of unjust and exploitative conditions within rental agreements, leaving students vulnerable to unscrupulous landlords. It is of utmost significance that rental property owners comprehend the legal consequences stemming from the inequity in the tenancy agreement since they are the ones responsible for its creation (Abdul Razak et al., 2019). 

Unfair rental contracts might not initially exhibit any evident consequences during the early stages of tenancy. Nevertheless, the situation could take a different turn when the problem eventually surfaces. Evidence of these claims can be observed in the Small Claims Court in Perak, involving Part 3 students pursuing a Diploma in Accountancy at UiTM Perak Branch, Tapah Campus, who filed a case against their landlord on January 22, 2018. In the legal case identified as Nur Aini Zurnizam & Anor v. Azmi Asaad and Anor, bearing the case reference AD-A77-2-11/2017, the judge determined that the defendants had violated the contract by requiring the plaintiffs to leave the specified premises. The court's verdict obligated the defendants to provide the plaintiffs with a total of RM 2240.00 in compensation, along with covering court costs totaling RM 100.00. This incident highlights the importance of having a well-structured rental agreement, which could be the essential factor in upholding justice for us if ever the need arises.

	A viable approach to tackling this problem involves creating a secure platform that enables university students and landlords to establish fair rental agreements while also facilitating monitoring. The suggested resolution involves the creation of a web-based application that will utilize blockchain technology to store rental contract agreements in a decentralized node. The intended system will be designed with a deployment of net-centric elements involving the incorporation of blockchain application programming interfaces (APIs) into the system.
