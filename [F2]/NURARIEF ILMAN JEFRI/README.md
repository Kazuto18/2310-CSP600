Issue
Food Waste And Food Insecurity In Malaysia

Evidence

-More than 50% of Malaysian wasted food daily.(phooi,azman,ismail,shah,koay,2022).
-The FAO projected that 687.8 million people (8.9%) or one in every ten people in the world are undernourished, while 750 million people (9.7%) worldwide were experiencing severe food insecurity. 
-Many businesses and individuals have extra food to give, but there's no practical way to connect with them immediately. This leads to food waste and ongoing hunger issues.

Problem Identification

-Food waste is a pervasive issue in Malaysia with extensive environmental repercussions. 
-Millions of individuals, including vulnerable populations in Malaysia, struggle with food insecurity and hunger. 
-Find surplus food and share it efficiently with those in need, but we currently lack a simple system to do this in real-time, resulting in missed opportunities to prevent waste and reduce hunger. 

Solution

-Implementing sustainable practices and technologies in food production and distribution, promoting food waste reduction at the consumer level through awareness and education, and supporting food rescue and donation initiatives to ensure that surplus food is redirected to those in need.
-Developing and supporting community-based initiatives to provide access to affordable and nutritious food, investing in local agriculture and food production, and creating efficient distribution channels to ensure that surplus food reaches individuals and communities facing food insecurity.
-A solution is to create a geolocation-based platform where food donors easily list their surplus food, which can be instantly shared with those in need.
