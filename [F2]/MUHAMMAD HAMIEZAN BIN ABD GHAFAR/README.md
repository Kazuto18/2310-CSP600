Project Statement
Issue
This project attempts to discover the underlying issues when it comes to renting and provide a smart solution for the problem. In the context of this study, the project attempts to utilize blockchain technology in solving the trends of issues related to rental contracts. Most common issue is the absence of a proper rental contract that was done verbally and open for being tempered at any time. 

Evidence
- Evidence of these claims can be observed in the Small Claims Court in Perak, involving Part 3 students pursuing a Diploma in Accountancy at UiTM Perak Branch, Tapah Campus, who filed a case against their landlord on January 22, 2018. In the legal case identified as Nur Aini Zurnizam & Anor v. Azmi Asaad and Anor, bearing the case reference AD-A77-2-11/2017, the judge determined that the defendants had violated the contract by requiring the plaintiffs to leave the specified premises. The court's verdict obligated the defendants to provide the plaintiffs with a total of RM 2240.00 in compensation, along with covering court costs totalling RM 100.00. 

- In Chen, Ye, & Rong work, they converted traditional rental agreements into smart rental contracts while utilizing IPFS technology to avoid storing a large amount of original data on the block. This approach focuses more on the architecture and creates a loophole in the data privacy as they did not implement any data encryption on the IPFS itself (Chen et al.,2019). 

Problem Identification
describe briefly problem matter
- Integrity of rental agreements and potential scams.
- Data privacy issue of the existing rental contract system

Solution
your final product and importance
- involves creating a secure platform using blockchain technology that enables university students and landlords to establish fair rental agreements while also facilitating monitoring.
- the solution would be the encryption of private data inside the contract and only displaying the terms and conditions visible to the public on the blockchain.
