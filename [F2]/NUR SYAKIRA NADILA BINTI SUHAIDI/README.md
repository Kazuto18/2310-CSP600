### Issue
The current fashion designer website lacks real-time features and efficient payment gateway integration, hindering the seamless interaction with clients and limiting the potential for online sales.

### Evidence
- Clients struggle to stay updated on the availability and status of fashion collections.
- Scheduling fittings is cumbersome, leading to potential appointment conflicts and dissatisfaction.
- The existing payment process is not user-friendly, leading to abandoned carts and missed sales opportunities.

### Problem Identification
The absence of real-time features, a streamlined appointment scheduling system, and an efficient payment gateway significantly affects user engagement and satisfaction. This issue not only results in client frustration but also leads to potential revenue loss and limits the ability to scale the business.

### Solution
To address these challenges, we will implement a real-time tracking system for fashion collections, enabling clients to stay informed about availability and number tracking instantly. Additionally, a user-friendly appointment scheduling system will be developed to simplify fittings booking. Furthermore, an efficient payment gateway will be integrated to enhance the online shopping experience. These solutions aim to elevate client satisfaction, and create a more convenient and responsive digital platform for Arif Khidin's fashion brand.
