1. Regarding the difficulty of comparing wedding planners and their services, almost three-quarters of those responding to the survey (73.3%) agreed with the statement. The realization that not everyone has highly developed abilities to conduct research over the internet has probably had an impact on this agreement. It indicates that some people might find it challenging to efficiently navigate different online platforms in order to discover more about various wedding organizers, which would make it difficult for them to make wise comparisons.

2. Around 80 percent of those who took the survey agreed that it is difficult for them to find out if certain dates have already been reserved by someone else. This challenge is caused by the requirement that reservations be made in person at the organizer's office. This high agreement percentage highlights the inconvenience and time waste that almost all of clients experience when they are not able to readily confirm date availability without visiting the location in person, leading to a systemic problem with existing booking process. The findings highlight the need for a more effective and user-friendly reservation system.

These difficulties could manifest as unclear communication channels, unresponsiveness, or delayed responses. The collected data highlights the frustration and annoyance that the majority of clients encounter when attempting to communicate with wedding organizers via the internet. It emphasizes how crucial it is to upgrade the online platforms' methods of communication in order to improve the whole experience for customers who are seeking wedding-related services.


### Problem Identification
describe briefly problem matter

1. Difficult to compare different wedding organizers and their services.
   Clients may find it difficult to compare various wedding organizers and the services they provide for a variety of reasons. Nowadays, wedding organizers promote their services on a variety of online platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. This implies that in order to acquire information more about different organizers, clients must browse through a variety of websites, social media accounts, and the online listings. Because of that, clients may find it challenging to centralize and standardize the data they gather from various sources due to the wide array of platforms. Direct comparisons can be difficult because each platform may display information in a somewhat different format. However, clients are also faced with a dilemma as a result of this abundance of choices. Selecting the venue for the wedding is a difficult task because there are a lot of things to take into consideration, such as the expected bride and groom's schedule and budget (Wibowo & Priandika, 2021). Therefore, to discover the organizer that best suits their demands and budget, they will need to put in a lot of time and effort exploring and browsing through several platforms.
   
2. The difficulty in discerning dates that have already been reserved by other clients.
   The problem is that it can be hard to find dates that other clients have already reserved. To make a reservation, potential clients must presently come in person to the organizer's office. But once they get there, they frequently discover that someone else already secured the desired date, which wastes their time. The fact that many clients work during the day as well as at night and have hectic schedules makes it difficult for them to physically visit the office, which adds to the inconvenience. Consequently, the existing booking process wastes time and burdens clients because they can't simply check the availability of dates without going to the organizer's office. This requires the development of a more accessible and efficient booking system.

3. Experiencing difficulties in contacting wedding organizers through existing online platform.
   Having trouble getting in touch with wedding planners via the variety of online digital platforms that are currently in use refers to the problems clients encounter when attempting to get in touch with wedding organizing experts. These problems can include unclear communication channels, uncooperative organizers, delayed answers, and technical difficulties with the platforms. Clients who are looking for fast and effective communication to talk about their wedding decisions, ask questions, or get clarification on specifics about the services provided may become frustrated as a result of these challenges. Essentially, the issue revolves on how difficult it is for clients to communicate with wedding planners online due to the ineffectiveness or inefficiency of the online interactions methods offered by these platforms.

### Solution

1. A filtering and sorting system could be put in place to greatly help with this problem. By allowing users to refine their search using key factors consisting of location, services provided, price range, and user ratings, such a system would enable users speed up their search. Developing a specific mobile application would also improve this system's accessibility and convenience. Using a user-friendly interface, this application could act as a centralized platform where different wedding organizers can list all of their services, packages, and prices. This would allow clients to compare and select the ideal wedding organizer based on their particular requirements and preferences. These alternatives would make comparing vendors easier while also giving people looking for wedding organizing assistance a more effective and user-friendly experience.
2. It becomes essential to implement a digital solution in regards to the issues raised in the survey.

Moreover, incorporating an easy-to-use booking system with options for selecting a date and time would greatly improve the process of booking. Customers would benefit from increased transparency as well as the ability to make well-informed booking decisions from the comfort of their homes or places of business, which would accommodate their busy schedules.
3. The implementation of a robust chat/messaging system is considered important to solving the challenges raised by the survey. Through the integration of a smooth and effective chat interface within the mobile application, clients are able to interact with wedding organizers directly, free from any delays or unclear platforms. Real-time communication is ensured by this solution, giving customers the ability to discuss specifics, ask questions, and get immediate answers which will greatly enhance their experience. A feature like this increases customer satisfaction through enabling direct communication and creating an easy-to-use open medium.
