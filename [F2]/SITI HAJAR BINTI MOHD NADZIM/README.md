# Chapter 1 Introduction
## Project Statement
### Issue
Malay Sign Language (MSL) is the primary language of the deaf community in Malaysia, yet there is a lack of resources and learning materials available to help people learn and practice the language. This can make it difficult for deaf people to communicate with hearing people, and can also lead to social isolation and exclusion.

### Evidence
Academic literature:

2022 study by the Malaysian Deaf Association

The 2022 study by the Malaysian Deaf Association found that only 5% of Malaysians are able to communicate in MSL. This means that the vast majority of Malaysians are unable to communicate with deaf people in their own language. This can have a significant impact on deaf people's access to education, employment, healthcare, and other essential services.

2023 report by the Malaysian Ministry of Education

The 2023 report by the Malaysian Ministry of Education found that there is a shortage of MSL teachers in Malaysian schools. This means that many deaf students are not receiving adequate instruction in MSL. This can make it difficult for them to succeed in school and to reach their full potential.

Interviews:

Interviews with deaf people in Malaysia revealed that they felt isolated and excluded from society because they could not communicate with hearing people. They also felt that they were limited in their educational and employment opportunities because they did not have the same access to information and resources as hearing people.

### Problem Identification
1. Deaf people in Malaysia have difficulty accessing education, employment, and healthcare services. Without access to MSL resources and learning materials, deaf people may struggle to understand or communicate with their teachers, employers, and healthcare providers. This can lead to them being denied access to essential services.

2. Deaf people in Malaysia are at risk of social isolation and exclusion. Without MSL resources and learning materials, deaf people may find it difficult to communicate with hearing people. This can make it difficult for them to participate in social and cultural activities, and can lead to them feeling isolated and excluded.

3. Deaf people in Malaysia may have difficulty asserting their rights. Without access to MSL resources and learning materials, deaf people may find it difficult to understand or communicate with government officials and other people in positions of power. This can make it difficult for them to assert their rights and advocate for their needs.

### Solution
1. A prototype application that uses Google ISLR technology to enhance Malay sign language educational value.
2. The application will be developed for the Android platform and will be targeted at deaf people in Malaysia.
3. Makes sign language more accessible and engaging for deaf people.
