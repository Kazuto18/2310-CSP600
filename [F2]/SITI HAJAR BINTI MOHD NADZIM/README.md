# Chapter 1 Introduction
## Project Statement
### Issue
1. Social isolation and exclusion: Deaf people who cannot communicate with hearing people are likely to feel isolated and excluded from society. This can have a significant impact on their mental health and well-being.

2. Limited educational and employment opportunities: Deaf people who do not have access to sign language education are likely to have limited educational and employment opportunities. This is because they will not be able to access the same information and resources as hearing people.

3. Reduced quality of life: The lack of access to sign language education can reduce the quality of life for deaf people. This is because they will not be able to fully participate in society and enjoy the same opportunities as hearing people.
