# Chapter 1 Introduction
## Project Statement
### Issue
Currently, handcrafting people are actively using social media like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok to interact with potential customers and showcase their work. This approach, however, has certain disadvantages, as it often results in problems with difficulty in locating local artisans, limited discoverability and a lack of specific technology to support the artist-client interaction.

According to the figure above, respondents are having difficulties when purchasing craft products from local artisans. In accordance with the responses related to the project's title, 51.9% of respondents claim that the difficulty comes from the lack of a centralized platform to discover local artisans. Given that the social media platforms they currently use are widely utilized, a local artisan has difficulty having a stand-out page. Furthermore, 37% of respondents indicated that they faced difficulty in locating local artisans in the nearest area. Purchasing the craft product from afar would be costly as the customer needs to pay for the shipping fee. Lastly, 18.5% choose challenges in finding local artisans capable of crafting customized products that align with customer designs. Finding an artist who offers a custom design service can be challenging as not everyone who sells can make a custom design in a timely manner.
