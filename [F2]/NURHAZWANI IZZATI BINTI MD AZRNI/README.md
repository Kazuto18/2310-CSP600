# Chapter 1 Introduction

## Project Statement

### Issue
Many tuition centers currently employ a manual tuition management system. This technique involves enrolling subjects at the administrator counter, marking attendance without notifying parents, and handling payments at the same counter.  

### Evidence
Basic facts either observation, questionnaire, interview, or article

  1. A look at the current fee management systems shows that they have problems with being inefficient, which means that teachers often          have trouble keeping accurate records of student attendance (Kamaroszaman,2022).
  2. Administrative functions related to tuition administration and education       
     arerarely automated (Mustapha,2022).
  3. Educational institutions lack transparency and accountability in tuition charge administration. This issue is especially important as       educational institutions move from cash-based payments to internet purchases, which are convenient but present challenges(Rahimi,2022).

### Problem Identification
Describe briefly the problem matter

  1. Inefficiency arises from the manual enrollment procedure, which is characterized by its time-consuming nature and the resulting     prolonged wait periods experienced by students and parents at the administrator's counter. Additionally, a substantial amount of administrative work is necessary.

  2. The absence of communication: The act of recording attendance without providing notification to parents can lead to a deficiency in transparency and communication among the tuition center, parents, and children. Parents may lack awareness regarding their child's attendance and academic achievement.

  3. Payment Processing Challenges: The consolidation of payment handling at a single counter can result in inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and complications in the monitoring of payment transactions. Additionally, the implementation of this system may give rise to security problems pertaining to the management of physical currency.

  4. Restricted Data Accessibility: Manual systems frequently exhibit a deficiency in facilitating convenient access and comprehensive analysis of data pertaining to student attendance and payments, hence impeding the ability to make well-informed decisions.

### Solution
your final product and importance

  1. Develop or implement a digital tuition management system that enables online topic enrollment, attendance notification, and payment processing.
  2. Develop an online portal or app through which students and parents can enroll in classes remotely. In-person enrollment at the administrator's counter is no longer required.
  3. Develop an online payment gateway to allow for simple and safe payments. Credit cards, online banking, and digital wallets are examples of payment methods. Payments can be made using the device of the student or parent's choice.
