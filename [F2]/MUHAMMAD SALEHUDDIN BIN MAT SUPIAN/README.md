Chapter 1 Introduction

Issue
Guardians often lack specialized tools for efficient fund allocation for their dependents.

Evidence
 * Disagreements about money occur in families at all income levels, and financial problems may be a symptom or result of other family problems that existed before a financial crisis (Williams & Berry, 1984; Aldous & Tuttle, 1988; Ulrichson & Hira, 1985). 
 * Financial matters have long been one of the most widely reported causes of family discord, with disagreement about money occurring in families at all income levels (Hogan & Bauer, 1988; Williams & Berry, 1984).

Problem Identification

* There is an absence of a dedicated financial management platform that specifically targets guardians and their dependents.
* Existing financial management applications are primarily designed for individual users, neglecting the specific * needs of guardians responsible for allocating funds and overseeing spending for their dependents.

Solution
To address these challenges, we propose the development of a dedicated platform designed to empower guardians with efficient fund management abilities. This platform simplifies the process of allocating funds and allows real-time spending monitoring, fostering financial literacy and enhancing family financial transparency.
