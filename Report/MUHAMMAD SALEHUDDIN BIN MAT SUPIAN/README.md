CHAPTER 1


INTRODUCTION




1.1	Background of Study

In the age of digital finance, personal finance management is undergoing a transformation, with e-wallets and mobile payment apps becoming increasingly popular. However, there remains a distinct need for a specialized solution to cater to the unique requirements of guardians responsible for managing allowances and funds for dependents. "GuardianWallet: Guardian's Fund Management Using Payment API" seeks to address this need by providing a dedicated platform tailored to the specific needs of guardians. This platform will empower guardians to efficiently manage funds for dependents, ensuring seamless fund allocation and real-time spending oversight, ultimately fostering financial literacy and enhancing family financial transparency.

1.2	Problem Statement

1.2.1	Lack of Dedicated Financial Management for Guardians

Guardians often face a significant challenge as they lack specialized tools tailored to their unique needs in managing allowances and funds for their dependents within their family. The issue arises from the fact that existing financial management applications primarily cater to individual users, thus neglecting the specific requirements of guardians who aim to allocate funds and oversee spending for their dependents. This absence of dedicated solutions can result in financial disarray within families, impeding guardians in their endeavors to allocate funds, establish spending limits, and ensure transparent financial management. The potential solution to this issue is "GuardianWallet," a dedicated platform designed to empower guardians with efficient fund management capabilities, fostering financial organization within families and addressing the specialized needs of fund allocation for dependents.
1.2.2	The Need for Seamless and Secure Fund Management

Guardians have a pressing need for a secure and user-friendly platform to efficiently manage funds and allowances for their dependents. The issue arises from the fact that existing solutions may not seamlessly integrate with secure payment APIs, posing challenges for guardians in efficiently managing funds and conducting transactions. This gap results in inconvenience for guardians and compromises their financial control and security when overseeing allowances and expenses. The potential solution lies in "GuardianWallet," which is designed to seamlessly integrate with secure payment APIs, guaranteeing both seamless and secure fund management for guardians. This integration offers convenience for transactions and robust financial monitoring, addressing the essential need for a secure and user-friendly platform for family financial management

1.2.3	Limited Financial Literacy Opportunities for Dependents

A prevalent issue arises as dependents often lack access to structured financial literacy education. This concern stems from the basic fact that without dedicated tools for fund allocation and spending monitoring, dependents may miss valuable opportunities to gain insights into responsible money management. The problem matter lies in the potential knowledge gap, which can lead to financial irresponsibility and hinder dependents' ability to make informed financial decisions in the future. To address this issue, "GuardianWallet" not only offers a solution for financial management but also provides educational resources to enhance financial literacy among dependents, fostering responsible financial behavior and ensuring that dependents are well-prepared to make informed financial decisions as they grow.

1.4.4	Functionality

One of the core functionalities of GuardianWallet is its ability to allow guardians to efficiently allocate funds to their dependents. Guardians can specify the amount to be allocated, the purpose of the allocation (e.g., weekly allowance, school fees, or specific expenses), and the frequency at which these allocations should occur. This feature simplifies the process of ensuring that dependents have access to the necessary funds for their various needs and expenses, all managed through a user-friendly interface.

The real-time spending monitoring feature provides guardians with an invaluable tool to oversee how the allocated funds are being utilized by their dependents. It allows guardians to access a live feed of transaction data, including details about where and when the money was spent. Guardians can categorize these expenses, enabling them to gain insights into their dependents' spending habits and providing opportunities for financial discussions within the family.

The comprehensive transaction history section in GuardianWallet allows both guardians and dependents to review past financial activities. This functionality provides a detailed record of all financial transactions, including fund allocations and expenditures. Users can search, filter, and sort through their transaction history, making it easier to track and understand the flow of funds within the family.

In line with the commitment to promoting financial literacy, GuardianWallet integrates an educational resources section. This includes a library of articles, videos, and interactive lessons on various financial topics, such as budgeting, saving, and responsible spending. These resources are accessible to dependents and are designed to equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to make informed financial decisions.

Security is paramount in GuardianWallet. The application employs advanced security measures to protect both data and financial transactions. Biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, add an extra layer of security, ensuring that only authorized users can access the application. In addition, transaction verification processes help safeguard financial activities, mitigating the risk of fraudulent transactions.

GuardianWallet empowers guardians to set customizable spending limits for their dependents. This feature serves as a valuable teaching tool, encouraging responsible spending habits. Guardians can define daily, weekly, or monthly limits, helping dependents learn about budgeting and financial discipline while giving guardians peace of mind regarding spending control. 

To keep users informed and up-to-date on their financial activities, GuardianWallet includes a robust notification system. Users receive real-time alerts and notifications about important financial events, such as fund allocations, completed transactions, and critical updates within the application. This feature ensures that both guardians and dependents stay well-informed and can respond promptly to financial matters.
