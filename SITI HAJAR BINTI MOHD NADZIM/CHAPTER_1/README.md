# Chapter 1 Introduction
## 1.1 Project Background
Sign language serves as the language for individuals who're deaf playing a crucial role in their communication, education and integration into society (Mohd Nasir & Ahmad 2019). Nonetheless there exist concerns related to sign language in Malaysia. These include awareness and comprehension of sign language, a shortage of sign language interpreters, limited availability of sign language in areas and inadequate incorporation of sign language into education (Chong, 2018).

  These challenges have the potential to have a substantial impact on the lives of Malaysian deaf people. They have the potential to cause social isolation, prejudice, and a lack of access to important services and opportunities. As one Malaysian deaf person put it, "Sign language is the key to our world." We are locked out without it" (Aishah & Abdullah, 2017).
  
  There are several approaches to addressing these difficulties, including raising sign language knowledge, training more sign language interpreters, making public spaces more accessible, and teaching sign language in schools (Wan Abdullah & Ismail, 2016). By solving these concerns, we can make Malaysia a more inclusive and accessible society for deaf people.

## 1.2 Problem Statement
**The lack of awareness and understanding of sign language, a shortage of sign language interpreters, a lack of sign language in public spaces, and a lack of sign language in education.**

  These challenges may have a substantial impact on the lives of Malaysian deaf people. It can result in social isolation, prejudice, and a lack of access to important services and opportunities.
  
  The difficulty of learning sign language is one specific example of a problem now confronting deaf persons in Malaysia. This is due to a variety of causes, including a lack of sign language interpreters in schools and a lack of sign language materials. As a result, many deaf persons in Malaysia do not have the opportunity to learn sign language, which might limit their communication, education, and work options.
  
  The AI Sign Language game application has the potential to transform how deaf people learn sign language. Deaf people can learn sign language at their own pace and in their own environment by using this application. This could make sign language more accessible to Malaysian deaf people, improving communication, education, and employment opportunities.
  
  The difficulty of learning sign language in Malaysia prevents deaf people from accessing essential communication, education, and employment opportunities (Mohd Nasir & Ahmad, 2019). The AI Sign Language game application has the potential to change the way deaf people learn sign language and improve their lives.

## 1.3 Objective
There are several objectives that this project will focus on :
1) To design and develop the prototype application called AI Sign Language game application on the Android platform.
2) To evaluate the prototype application using User Acceptance Testing using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.

## 1.4 Project Scope
In order to improve the educational value of sign language, this project will design, develop, and evaluate a prototype application that makes use of Google's Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) technology. The Android operating system will be used to construct the prototype application. 

  A machine learning technique developed by Google called Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is able to identify individual signs in videos of Malay sign language. A smartphone gaming app that teaches individuals Malay sign language that can be used to improve the educational value of sign language.

  The project will take the following strategy, such as designing the prototype application with a user-centered design approach. This will entail performing user surveys and usability testing to ensure that the application is simple to use and satisfies the demands of its intended audience.

   The prototype application will then be created using the Android Studio programming environment. The Google ISLR API will be used by the program to recognize isolated sign language signs. The prototype application will next be reviewed using several methods such as accuracy testing, usability testing, and user feedback.

  The prototype application capability will recognize isolated sign language signs using Google Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) technology. In an AI Malay Sign Language app, users will be able to sign the type of bubble they wish to shoot, and the app will identify the sign and generate the appropriate bubble. The application will also give users feedback on their sign language accuracy.

  Deaf people in Malaysia are the project's intended end users. The project is intended to help deaf people learn sign language and participate in educational activities. The prototype application will be evaluated with a sample size of 20 deaf people. This sample size will be determined by participant availability.

  The Android platform will be used to develop the prototype application. This is due to the fact that the Android platform is popular in Malaysia and is accessible to a large number of deaf people.

## 1.5 Project Significance
The initiative will help address the practical issue of improving sign language accessibility for Malaysian deaf individuals. Deaf people will have an easy way to learn sign language and take part in educational activities thanks to the AI Malay Sign Language prototype game.

  Additionally, the study will help Malaysian educators and legislators make decisions. The project's results will include details on how well Google ISLR technology works to make educational apps more accessible to the deaf community. The creation of laws and initiatives that aid in the education of the deaf can be guided by the information provided here.

  The project will contribute to a better solution for making sign language more accessible to deaf people. The AI Malay Sign Language prototype game application will offer deaf people a new and innovative way to learn sign language. The project findings will also include information on how Google ISLR technology can be used to improve deaf people's access to educational applications. This information can be used to develop more effective and user-friendly educational applications for deaf people. Furthermore, this knowledge can be used to create new and innovative educational applications for deaf people that are more accessible and engaging.

  Overall, the project has the potential to make a significant contribution to the real world by improving the solution to the problem of making sign language more accessible to deaf people and developing future educational applications for deaf people.

## 1.6 Summary
Deaf people's native language is sign language, and it is essential for their communication, education, and participation in society. However, there are several issues with sign language in Malaysia, including a lack of sign language awareness and understanding, a shortage of sign language interpreters, a lack of sign language in public spaces, and a lack of sign language in education.

  These issues have the potential to have a significant impact on the lives of Malaysian deaf people. They have the potential to cause social isolation, discrimination, and a lack of access to essential services and opportunities. The difficulty of learning sign language is one specific example of a problem currently faced by deaf people in Malaysia. This is due to a variety of factors, including a scarcity of sign language interpreters in schools and a scarcity of sign language resources. As a result, many deaf Malaysians are unable to learn sign language, limiting their communication, education, and employment opportunities.

  The AI Malay Sign Language game application has the potential to transform how deaf people learn sign language. Deaf people can learn sign language at their own pace and in their own environment by using this application. This could make sign language more accessible to Malaysian deaf people, improving communication, education, and employment opportunities.

  The project's goal is to design, develop, and test an AI Malay Sign Language game application for the Android platform. The application will recognize isolated sign language signs using Google's Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) technology. The app will then provide users with feedback on their sign language accuracy.

  The project's intended end users are Malaysian deaf people. The project's goal is to assist deaf people in learning sign language and participating in educational activities. Plus, it is significant because it has the potential to improve the lives of Malaysian deaf people by making sign language more accessible and developing new and innovative deaf educational applications.
